what is Gibbs free energy?
To explore the dynamic properties behind mutations, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have been widely performed, especially in unveiling the mechanism of drug failure behind mutation. When comparing wild type (WT) and mutants (MTs), the structural changes along with solvation free energy (SFE), and Gibbs free energy (GFE) are calculated after the MD simulation, to measure the effect of mutations on protein structure.
