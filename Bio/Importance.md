### Data
protTrans:
filter proteins with resolution <= 2.5A and >= 20 residues

mutabind2:
 filter proteins>= 20 residues

complexes with modified residues at the protein-protein binding interface ?

### task

to study what is Mmseqs2.
what is percentage pairwise sequence identity?

MutaBind2:
we can remove bias(more data, more performance on bind affinty decrease) by developing new energy functions, so what is developing new energy functions?
